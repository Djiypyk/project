# Hi there

## _This app is in development and not yet ready for release._

And it is a test one in which I experiment and configure different configurations of utilities such as webpack, eslint, jest, snapshot and etc.

## Architecture

I try to stick to the Feature Slice Design architecture. But if you have any comments or suggestions about the architecture, feel free to leave your feedback.

## Stack

- JS/TS
- React
- Redux Toolkit Query (in future)
- Jest, React testing library
- Storybook
- Loki
- Husky

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd prod_project
npm i
```
